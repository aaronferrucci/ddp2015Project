# ddp2015Project
Course Project for Developing Data Products, Fall 2015

The project assignment is fairly open-ended - make some sort of data visualization using shiny. I'm using data from the 2015 
Wharf to Wharf race in Santa Cruz, CA.

The pitch presentation is available here:

The app is hosted on shinyapps.io, here:
