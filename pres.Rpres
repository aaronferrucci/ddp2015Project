Data Exploration: Wharf to Wharf 2015 Results 
========================================================
author: Aaron Ferrucci
autosize: true
date: `r format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %Y")`

Explore the Race!
========================================================
type: slide2
``` {r echo=F}
dataset <- read.csv("data/clean.csv")
num_runners <- nrow(dataset)
```
* The [Wharf to Wharf Race](http://www.wharftowharf.com/) is a 6-mile foot race that occurs every summer in Santa Cruz, California

* More than `r sprintf("%d", signif(num_runners - 500, 2))` runners participated in the 2015 Wharf to Wharf race, and you can look up the results online, but only  [one runner at a time](http://results.xacte.com/?kw=wtw).

* Seeing an overall picture of the race data, like the distribution of runner elapsed time, as a function of age and sex, was difficult... until now.

* The Wharf to Wharf 2015 Explorer enables easy exploration of the data, in one handy chart.

* The app is available now: https://aaronferrucci.shinyapps.io/w2w2015

You control the X, you control the Y. Also color.
========================================================
type: slide3
* On the left-hand side of the app you can choose the X and Y variables
of the plot. A third drop-down list specifies which variable controls color.

* Do runners with an earlier start time finish the race faster? Try plotting start time vs. elapsed time.

* Did the average foreigner get an earlier start time than the average American? Plot start time vs. country.
  * Set color to "sex", and you'll see an interesting effect: all the Ethiopian runners were female, while the Japanese, Eritrean and Japanese runners were all male. (Runners from Kenya and the USA are of both genders.)

Jitter & Smoothing
========================================================
type: slide4
* One checkbox enables jitter in the plotted data points.
  * This is handy when one of the axes is a factor variable (country or sex).

* A second checkbox enables smoothing. With this option turned on, trends in the data are easier to spot. 
  * For example, among the top 100 runners, female runners appear to run faster, the older they are, but for men, it's the reverse. (X: age, Y: elapsed time, limit to rank: 100, enable smoother).

Summary and Future Work
========================================================
type: slide5
* The Wharf to Wharf 2015 Explorer enables easy exploration of this data set,
with no need to type any code. 

* Future effort can apply the same treatment to earlier Wharf to Wharf race results.
